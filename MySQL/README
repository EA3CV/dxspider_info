# DXSpider – Support for Berkeley DB and MariaDB/MySQL Backends

This directory contains the necessary modules to enable DXSpider to use either the traditional **Berkeley DB (`DB_File`)** or a relational **MariaDB/MySQL** database as its user storage backend, depending on manual configuration.

## Purpose

To allow DXSpider to operate with either **`DB_File`** (the legacy system) or **MariaDB/MySQL** for storing user information, while maintaining full compatibility with the original interface (`get`, `put`, `del`, `close`, etc.).

## Included Files

- `DB_File.pm`  
  The original module based on `DB_File`, used by default in DXSpider.

- `DB_Mysql.pm`  
  An alternative module implementing an SQL backend for users, supporting the `users_new` table in a MariaDB/MySQL database.

- `DXUser.pm`  
  A patched version of the module adapted to work with the selected backend (Berkeley or MySQL), without altering system-wide logic.

- `DXVars.pm`  
  Updated to define new global variables required for MariaDB/MySQL operation.

- `update_new_sysop.pl`  
  A script that replaces the original `update_sysop.pl`. It is designed to initialise the `mycall` and `myalias` users with optional password and registration support, specifically for use with MySQL.

- `export_users_mysql.pl`  
  A script that replaces `export_users.pl`, used to back up the MySQL user database to `users_backup.sql` and a `user_json` file.

- `export_v3j_to_mysql.pl`  
  A migration script for transferring user records from the original Berkeley DB `users.v3j` to the new `users_new` table in MySQL.

## Selecting the Backend

Backend selection is made **by directly editing the source code** where `tie %u, ...` is used — replace `'DB_File'` with `'DB_Mysql'` as needed.

> ⚠️ There is no automatic logic to select the backend using a global variable. Selection is manual and explicit.

## Requirements for the MariaDB Backend

- A MariaDB database with the `users_new` table correctly created (see `DESCRIBE users_new;`).
- Connection variables must be defined in `DXVars.pm`:
  - `$main::mysql_db`
  - `$main::mysql_user`
  - `$main::mysql_pass`
  - `$main::mysql_host`
- Required Perl modules:
  - `DBI`
  - `DBD::mysql`
  - `JSON`
  - `Scalar::Util`
  - `Encode`

## Advantages of the MariaDB Backend

- Fast and flexible direct SQL queries.
- Shared access to a single user database across multiple DXSpider nodes.
- Improved maintainability, backups, and data migration.
- Full support for `utf8mb4` and special characters.

## Warning

There is no synchronisation between the Berkeley and MariaDB backends. Migration must be done manually using the provided export/import scripts.
